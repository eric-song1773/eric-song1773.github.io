## Importance of Coding Standards In Software Development Environment 

The purpose of using programming languages is to create a program in a language where both programmers and the computer can understand without having to individually writing 
billions of 0s and 1s. However, if the result codes are disorganized to the point where the codes are almost impossible to comprehend, the purpose of using a programming 
language loses its purpose. I strongly agree coding standards should be taken as a priority in a programming environment, as learning the coding standard can actually help learning
the programming language. Learning programming requires reading a variety of materials, and the code itself is one of them. If the codes that are organized through the usage of 
coding standards the readability will significantly increase, which lessen the difficulty of comprehending the programming material, allowing the beginners to learn the programming
language is easier.

## First Week Experience With Using ESLint: An Uncomfortable Encounter

My first experience with code quality tools was in ICS 211 with the combination with Eclipse IDE. The main difference I have witnessed between ESLint and the code quality tool 
I used in ICS 211 was the representation of the coding standard mistakes. When there was a problem involving coding standards while writing the program, ESLint would underline 
the coding standard problem with red squiggly lines, as if the coding standard mistakes are considered equivalent to creating a critical mistake that will not allow the computer
to understand. My first impression with ESLint was annoying than helpful, as I would be worried if I actually made a fatal error for the code to run, and I would eventually find 
out that it was just highlighting the coding standard mistakes. 

## No Pain, No Gain: In Programming Environment

However, while it is true that ESLint is still annoying to work with, as I do not like to continue coding when there is a visible red squiggly lines underneath my codes,
ESLint in the long run will help me learn a good habit of writing my code in an organized manner. In the future where I do get a job as a programmer, the job of programming
will most require working with different programmers. In order to successfully work as a team in programming environment, while it is essential to write a code that actually
works, it is also important for me to write a code in a way so that other programmers can easily comprehend what I wrote, without having to read the codes multiple time and
making them wrap around their head with frustration.
