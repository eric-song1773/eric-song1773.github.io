  # JavaScript: From the Perspective From a Java Programmer
  
  <img class="ui medium center floated rounded image" src="../images/js-image.jpg">
  
  ## Simplicity of JS in comparison of Java
  
  Programming beginners can be confusing when it comes to finding the difference between JavaScript and Java, due to the similarity of the title.
  However, just from taking a closer look and comparing the basics of Java and JavaScript will make the beginners realize that they are completely different.
  After spending approximately a week for exposing myself to programming environment using JavaScript I was able to observe that the system of coding in 
  JavaScript is simpler compared to Java. 
  
  The simplicity of JavaScript comes from the unification of the primitive types. The variable initialization of Java comes with 8 different primitive types, such 
  as int, boolean, long, float, etc. JavaScript on the other hand was able to simplify its variable initialization by reducing the variable type to "let", "var", and const. 
  My first thoughts that came through my mind when realizing the JavaScript's simpication of variable type surprised me, since it looked wrong to have boolean value and numerical
  value in one type from the perspective of a beginner programmer who started from Java.
  
  ## Effective of JavaScript In Software Development (And Video Game Design) 
  
  I believe using JavaScript for the purpose of developing a software is an excellent choice, due to its easier difficulty of code writing, which comes from simple and less 
  redundancy. However, looking at programming from the perspective from myself, who is trying to become a programmer in a video game industry, JavaScript might not be the number one
  priority. Many major video game industry, also known as "AAA game companies", mostly use C or C++ as their main video game developing tool, which means mastering C/C++, which are
  more redundant and complex relative to JavaScript, is still required.
  
  ## Practicalness of Athletic Software Engineering
  
  Athletic software engineering, also referred to as WODs, are an excellent way to practice coding interviews beginner programmers will have in the future. From the practice WODs 
  I had so far seemed very similar to the environment of how the coding interview will be structured. Although I still get good amount of stress and nervousness from working under time pressure, the situation
  will happen often inevitably, meaning continuous exposure to WODs is necessary and will benefit in the long run.
