## My Experience So Far In Software Development

My overall experience so far as a student learning how to become an software engineer has been an unique experience
that I have never encountered from previous ICS courses provided in University of Hawaii at Manoa. ICS 314, the ICS
class I was able to take this semester provided experiences closer to environment of actually working as a software
engineer in a company. There were some times where I was not able to finish time limited assignment on time and
doubted by overall ability as a software engineer, but after finishing a final project of creating my very own and
My teammates' fully functioning website was a very fulfilling experience I have not had for a while. From my
journey in software development, user interface frameworks and codings standards are the two key concepts that I
was able to develop myself as a better software engineer.

## User Interface Frameworks

Those to people who are not familiar with the concept of User Interface Framework, it is basically a handy dandy
tool, as it is described in my previous essay about UI framework, that makes the overall process of software
development is easier. In my case of using User Interface Frameworks, Semantic UI definitely helped me a lot through
the process of software development. Referring back to my previous essay, "UI Framework, A Handy-Dandy Tool,
But Should Everyone Use It?", I had different view on UI Framework, that UI Framework might possibly have a problem
when it comes to optimization issues. However, I have realized that is not the main problem of using UI framework,
but it has to do with the problem of being limited inside the framework, as there are development restriction that
comes with using the framework. I still believe UI framework is highly recommended, especially if you are just getting
into the field of software engineering. 

## Coding Standards: Not Only to Make It Look Clean

Coding standards is also an important key concept that every software engineer should know. There is a famous
saying that goes around in the software development environment, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". However, this
is not the case for coding standards. The definition of coding standards is straight forwards, It is the universal
standard that is required to be followed in the coding environment. In order to keep up with following the coding
standard, ESLint definitely helped me a lot, to the point where it felt "wrong" to write codes without having 
ESLint disabled. As I would be working with multiple group of people in the future, I think it is safe to say that
I have developed a good habit from this experience. 

## The Software Engineering Journey Will Never Ends

Being a software engineer cannot just end with being "done" with studying soft engineering. Although the software
engineering techniques I was able to learn from ICS 314 was definitely an astonishing experience, but this is only
a fraction of what I would potentially learn as a software engineer in the future. Being a software engineer is 
definitely not the easiest thing in the world. However, with the feeling of accomplishment that I always get every
The time I finish a project is the reason that motivates me to continue learning what it takes to be a software engineer.
