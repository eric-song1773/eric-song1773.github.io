Inverse Tic-Tac-Toe (ITTT) is a variant of the game Tic-Tac-Toe we know of. Unlike the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, which is a two player game where the player that can create 3 in
a row first before the opponent wins the game, the ITTT is the complete opposite, where you have to force the opponent to get 3 shapes in a row to win the game. It's also a one player game with AI as the opponent. The project was solely programmed on Java Eclipse IDE with GUI being implemented.
